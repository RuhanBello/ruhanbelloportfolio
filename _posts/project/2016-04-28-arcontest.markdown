This is a contest game that was firstly executed in an event that happened here in Brazil, at Parna√≠ba. In the contest, the players had to run through the event's space with the mission to find the Augmented Reality Cards that were hidden. When the player points to an AR card, a mini-game comes out from it within the smartphone screen.

The player who finishs all the mini-games in less time is the winner of the contest.
